					"value": "A vulnerability affecting some implementations of TLS 1.x with CBC cipher modes has been discovered that allows an attacker to decrypt some encrypted contents under certain conditions (CVE-2014-8730). This padding-oracle attack on TLS CBC cipher modes is a variant of the POODLE vulnerability, commonly known as “POODLE Bites”.  This issue is confirmed to affect PAN-OS implementation of TLS 1.x.  (Ref #72544)\nThe conditions of successful exploitation are similar to the POODLE and BEAST attacks, which require several conditions to be met for successful exploitation (i.e. the attacker requires a man-in-the-middle position in the network and must also be able to direct the victim client to send many repeated requests to the vulnerable server on behalf of the attacker via scripting, web sockets, or similar mechanism). Due to the conditions required of a successful attack scenario, the risk of exploitation is not particularly high. More information can be found in Microsoft Security Advisory 3009008 (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3009008).\nThis issue affects PAN-OS 6.1.1 and earlier; PAN-OS 6.0.8 and earlier; PAN-OS 5.0.15 and earlier",
