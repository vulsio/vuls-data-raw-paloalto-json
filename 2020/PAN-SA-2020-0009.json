The study aims to make network administrators aware that they must carefully deploy their VPN solutions. This study highlights the fact that VPN-only solutions do not offer the level of security required for clients connecting from untrusted networks.\n\nResearchers conducted this study to measure the efficacy of VPNs in a controlled lab environment where they disabled host firewalls and threat prevention features and conducted attacks that are considered known risks in an untrusted network. This research does not demonstrate a new vulnerability or a novel attack technique.\n\nPalo Alto Networks products, such as GlobalProtect™, Cortex™ XDR, and threat prevention features and subscriptions on our next-generation firewalls, are ideally suited to address the risks considered in the study.\n\nThis study illustrated the importance of enabling GlobalProtect features related to captive portals and of enabling additional layers of security through endpoint protection and next-generation firewall features.\n",
