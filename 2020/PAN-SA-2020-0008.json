This vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution within the boot environment, which allows persistent control of the system.\n\nIt is not possible for malicious actors or PAN-OS administrators to exploit this vulnerability under normal conditions. Administrators do not have access to the grub configuration file nor do they have permission to modify it. An attacker would need to first compromise the system and then get the root Linux privileges necessary to perform these actions before they could exploit this vulnerability. The BootHole vulnerability itself does not allow an attacker to compromise PAN-OS software.\n\nPalo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.\n\nThe Palo Alto Networks Product Security Assurance team evaluated this potential vulnerability and determined that the scenarios required for successful exploitation of the BootHole vulnerability do not exist on PAN-OS software under normal conditions.\n",
