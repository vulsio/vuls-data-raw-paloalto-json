This security advisory will be updated as more information becomes available or if there are changes in the impact of these vulnerabilities.\nPAN-OS/Panorama platforms are not directly impacted by these vulnerabilities, as successful exploitation on PAN-OS devices requires an attacker to have already compromised the PAN-OS operating system. We treat any vulnerability that compromises PAN-OS to allow the execution of code as a critical vulnerability. Any such vulnerability would be urgently patched and made available in a PAN-OS maintenance update for all supported versions of PAN-OS.\n \n Because of the low risk of the vulnerability and the relatively high risk of known patch options, the risk and impact must be carefully considered and thoroughly understood.  We will continue to monitor the situation as it evolves, and to evaluate patching options available from our partner vendors as they become available.  We will update this bulletin with updates regarding software patches or other mitigations as they become available.\n \n For more background, please see the following https://researchcenter.paloaltonetworks.com/2018/01/understanding-affected-not-vulnerable/.",
